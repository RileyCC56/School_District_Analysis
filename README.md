# PyCity Schools District Analysis

The following school board of PyCity Schools has notified Maria that there has been evidence of academic dishonesty. The board believes that scores may have been altered within the Thomas High School ninth grade for reading and math. As the school board would like to uphold their state-testing stadards, Maria has asked if we can just replace the "altered" ninth grade math and reading scores from Thomas High School to produce the analysis we previously created for Maria. The previously created analysis portrayed the district summary, school summary, top and bottom performing schools based on passing rate, average math and reading score for each grade and school, and score by school spending per student, size and type.

## Results
As the newly updated analysis now supplements all Thomas High School ninth grade math and reading scores the following summaries below have been modified.

- The district summary has little to no changes as we have only removed 461 students that could have factored into our math and reading scores. As this small size has been removed to not be accounted for our percentages have droped by less than 1%.

- The school summary has only been affected by the changes within Thomas High School as the ninth grade results we also accounted for. Given the following circumstances the results and percentages of all the math,reading, and overall increased to a great extent. 

Please see below for the results of before excluding replacing the ninth grade math and reading scores:

  - The scores by school spending have not been affected as the grades and the school budgets do not correlate in relation to one and another.
  - The scores by school size have also not been affected as we have still included the students within the population, we have just not included their scores.
  - The scores by school type was also not affected as the math and reading scores are still in correlation with the school types.

## Summary
As we have made the following changes of replacing the ninth-grade of Thomas High School math and reading scores to "Nans" we have noticed the following changes with our analysis:

- The percentage of passing in math and reading has increased from 70% to 90%
- The overall passing percentage has increased from 65% to 90%
- Thomas High School has jumped from a low performing school based on overall percentage to now a top performing school based on overall percentage
